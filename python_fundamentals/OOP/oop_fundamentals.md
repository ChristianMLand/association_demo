# Four Pillars
## Abstraction
> Only make certain aspects of the program accessible from outside of the class (private methods)
## Encapsulation
> Wrapping up the methods and attributes of the class within the class itself
## Inheritance
> A class' ability to inherit attributes and methods from other classes (keeps your code DRY)
## Polymorphism
> Classes that inherit from each other being able to invoke the same method and receive a different result

# SOLID Principles
## **S**ingle responsibility principle
> Every class and every function should have only one responsiblity
## **O**pen-closed principle
> Software should be open for extension, but closed for modification
## **L**iskov substitution principle
> An instance of a parent class should be able to be replaced with an instance of a subclass without breaking the program
## **I**nterface segregation principle
> Multiple specialized interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
## **D**ependency inversion principle
> Depend upon abstractions rather than concrete implementations

# General tips
- Model your classes based on behaviours not properties
- Model your data based on properties and not on behaviours
- favor composition over inheritance
